Beneath the arched culvert is a shallow furrow – now dry but once it was the riverbed of the mighty Karatoa. Nowadays, some water flows here during the monsoon. But most of the time it stays dry. \"Even when I was 25 I saw a youthful Karatoa. The overflowing waves of the Karatoa would hit the surrounding villages during the monsoon.",

                "description": "Thousands of people lose their homes in the country every year due to river erosion. Besides, many hectares of land are crumbled into the rivers in the country. The land erosion escalates mainly during the monsoon (June to October).As many as 0.3 million families are living in the 165 char areas (river shoals) of Gaibandha district, according to the district administration.One of the climate victims of the area, Jaigun Begum, 45, said,  We don't know how long we, the climate-affected people in char regions, will have to face tribulations caused by the river erosion. She is now residing at Horipur under Sundarganj Upazila in Gaibandha. Her sanitation facilities were destroyed by the erosion.Women, children and differently-able people in her locality go through endless sufferings during persistent floods. Lamenting it, she said,  We have been facing the disasters for so long. \r According to Jaigun, they suffer from malnutrition as food and medicine are not always available there.On March 21, South Asian Climate Change Journalists Forum (SACCJF) in association with Gana Unnayan Kendra (GUK), a development organisation, organised a public hearing on climate change at Kunderpara Char in Gaibandha Sadar with the climate victims.State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Md Enamur Rahman attended the event as the chief guest.At the char on the bank of the Brahmaputra River, a total of 13 climate-affected people from Kurigram, Lalmonirhat and Gaibandha shared the horrific impact of the disaster on their lives and livelihood.The organisers claimed that this is the first event in Bangladesh to listen to the people of climate victims in the char area.A sexagenarian, Badsha Mia, resident of Haripur Union under Sundarganj Upazila of Gaibandha, said that he and his family members were victims of river erosion seven times so far.He struggled a lot to manage a decent job to survive with his family members. Meanwhile, he lost the strength of his both legs in an accident at his workplace.Sitting on a wheelchair, Badshah Mia said,  You come to us with relief goods during the disasters, but you don't see our hardship throughout the year .None understands the sufferings of us throughout the year due to river erosion, Badsha Mia added.Ainun Nishat, water resource and climate change specialist, spoke at the hearing while SACCJF president Asish Gupta and development worker Professor Zahirul Qayyum, were also present.Ainun Nishat said more than 15 million people in char areas across the country remain at serious risk due to the climate change.The main responsibility for climate change rests with the developed world, Nishat said. We need to speak up for the people who are bearing the brunt of climate change. We need to address the loss and damage of the people and convince the Western countries to reduce environmental pollution,  he added.Jaigun Begum also said that the women in the erosion area are the worst sufferers. No one understands their consistent grief, she said, adding that girls in disaster-prone areas are prevented from going to school. They have problems during puberty. She further said,  Sometimes they are sexually harassed when they take shelters leaving their houses during the flood. People with disabilities experience extreme pain and sufferings. Young people look older due to lack of nutrition, Jaigun lamented.No outsider can even imagine what kind of pain and pangs one has to suffer in the char region during pregnancy, she added. She also said,  We heard that sudden floods, river erosion are occurring continuously due to climate change. Terming that rich countries are responsible for the climate-related disasters, she urged the government to tell those countries to hear their stories of suffering.Mosharraf Hossain, resident of Hatibandha of Lalmonirhat, said hailstorms are destroying crops, killing animals and people.Lucky Begum from Phulchari Upazila of Gaibandha, broke down in tears while talking about the sufferings she had during the floods in 2019.An unexpected and sudden flood occurred in 2019 in the area. She had seek help from neighbours as her husband was away for his job.Begum said,  What was my state of mind on that time, I can't explain it. You won't understand that. sajibur@gmail.com",

This exceptional geographical location makes the country most unprotected to the impact of climate change, specially Bhola district. Each year this coastal area hits by natural calamities like cyclone, flood, soil erosion, nor’wester etc. During rainy season riverbank erosion shows it’s fearsome look and takes mighty lands from inhabitants of Bhola. These environmental disasters force people to migrate to near island and other parts of the country, particularly Dhaka. \r Impacts of climate change is no longer just on the book or just an expert’s talk. It’s now visible with empirical evidence. In Dhaka there is a slum called Bhola Bosti(Bhola Slum) where nearly 250 family lives and most of them are climate change refugees from Bhola. This force migration has been deteriorating the current socio-economic condition of Dhaka city.",

                "description": "More than one million forcefully displaced Myanmar nationals, known as Rohingyas, are currently living in the 34 camps in the Cox’s Bazar district in Bangladesh. To reduce the pressure of Rohingyas in Cox’s Bazar, the government of Bangladesh has started the process of relocating some of the Rohingyas to Bhasan Char Island located in Noakhali district, Bangladesh. However, some international organisations, NGOs, and some people expressed their concerns over this relocation process. This article, thus, offers an evidence-based holistic perspective that explains the available facilities and opportunities that could bring a new hope instead of a threat to Rohingyas. Through a multi-method research approach, the paper argues that the Island is suitable for the displaced Rohingya people. It also explores that the relocation project has opportunities for Rohingyas to engage in some livelihood activities. The Island is stable and livable on a temporary basis and has adequate safety and security measures–embankments, wave breakers, shelter centers, and modern housing facilities–have been undertaken. This article, thus, concludes that Bhasan Char can offer a new hope–not a place with threats, for the Rohingya displaced people, to live temporarily before their repatriation to Myanmar.",

Both primary and secondary data have been used to conduct this work. Primary data have been collected through extensive field work, questionnaire and sample collection. Water samples have been collected from three sampling station, namely Ganjapara, Chengi Bridge and Rubber factory sites. Water temperature is higher at different sampling stations in the study site than Bangladesh standards (25°C) due to the direct hit of the sun. The maximum DO value is 5.8 mg/l at the sampling station one and the minimum is 5.3 mg/l at station three. So, it concluded that the DO value of the Chengi river is comparatively lower than the Bangladesh Standards. The water Temperature and pH is higher than the Bangladesh standards and the value of other parameters are very lower than the Bangladesh standards. In fish diversity, 10 families belonging to 6 orders were recorded and identified by the fin formula. The order Cypriniformes occupied 40%, the order Perciformes which occupies 25% and the order Beloniformes, Siluriformes, Cyprinodontiformes occupied 10% and Mollusks and other invertebrates occupied 25%, respectively in all cases. This work provides a complete picture of the water quality and also the fish diversity of the Chengi River. It will be helpful for water resource management and planning.",

Bangladesh, predominantly an agrarian country, has a long tradition of cereal grains cultivation, consumption and conservation. Rice is the staple food for millions (of people) across the globe including Bangladesh. It occupies more than 96% of the land area under “Cereal Agriculture” in Bangladesh. Maize occupies the 2nd position both in acreage and production followed by wheat and other minor cereals viz. barley, sorghum and millets. In this chapter, the historical development and production scenario of different cereal crops and their present status, constraints, challenges and opportunities has been described and discussed. The information presented here would provide a clear inside of the “Cereal Agriculture of Bangladesh” to students, researchers, administrators, policymakers, and the common people as well.",
